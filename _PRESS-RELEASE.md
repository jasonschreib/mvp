There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Daily Cardio Log

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  This product is targeted towards anyone who is interested in recording amount of exercise done per day, specifically those doing cardio or those needing extra motivation to keep track of exercise; main benefits include allowing users to document their workout regimen and having a source of truth for their exercise - there's no getting around a blank exercise log!

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  This product is an online exercise log, which requires consumers to take 1 minute every day after a cardio workout session to record a couple details about their workout, such as time spent and yardage done. The benefits include allowing consumers to have a readable and accessible log of all exercise they have done in a certain amount of time. It keeps users accountable as well, as the amount of exercise they have done is all stored in the app -- in other words, if you haven't done enough exercise to meet you goal, then it will be able to figure out!

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

The problem this product solves is the problem that many people have of not being able to have a record of all workouts they've done. It promotes accountability for users too, they have to come to terms with the amount of exercise they've been doing! There's no cutting corners!

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

By providing a streamlined, easy-to-use application, users can simply type in a couple of details about their workout and then be on their way. MAY NOT YET BE INCLUDED: Users may be able to filter on the application to see yardage or time spent exercising in a given time frame.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

"Exercise is such an important part of a balanced life and our app is perfect for YOU! Yes you! Use our application to keep track of your specific exercise sessions and push yourself to exercise!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

Just as easy as going to the webpage and logging your first session!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "Wow, this is amazing! Ever since I started doing this log, I've been exercising every day! I can't believe it, it really keeps me so accountable. I also realized that I'm doing lots of yardage! Go me!!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

Go ahead and get started on our app. Exercise and log for a few days, then check out your progress.
